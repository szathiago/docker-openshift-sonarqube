To do that, you must install and configure the scanner that is most appropriate for your needs.

However, if you need to set some configuration on your project before its first analysis, you have the option of provisioning it via Administration options.\\n\\n## What does analysis produce? \\nSonarQube can perform analysis on 20+ different languages. The outcome of this analysis will be quality measures and issues (instances where coding rules were broken). However, what gets analyzed will vary depending on the language:\\n\\n* On all languages, \\\"blame\\\" data will automatically be imported from supported SCM providers. Git and SVN are supported automatically. Other providers require additional plugins.\\n* On all languages, a static analysis of source code is performed (Java files, COBOL programs, etc.)\\n* A static analysis of compiled code can be performed for certain languages (.class files in Java, .dll files in C#, etc.)\\n* A dynamic analysis of code can be performed on certain languages.\\n\\n## Will _all_ files be analyzed?\\nBy default, only files that are recognized by a language analyzer are loaded into the project during analysis. For example if your SonarQube instance had only SonarJava SonarJS on board, all .java and .js files would be loaded, but .xml files would be ignored. \\n\\n## What happens during analysis?\\nDuring analysis, data is requested from the server, the files provided to the analysis are analyzed, and the resulting data is sent back to the server at the end in the form of a report, which is then analyzed asynchronously server-side.\\n\\nAnalysis reports are queued, and processed sequentially, so it is quite possible that for a brief period after your analysis log shows completion, the updated values are not visible in your SonarQube project. However, you will be able to tell what's going on because an icon will be added on the project homepage to the right of the project name. Mouse over it for more detail (and links if you're logged in with the proper permissions).\\n\\n![background task processing in progress.](/images/backgroundTaskProcessingInProgress.jpeg)\\n\\n\\nThe icon goes away once processing is complete, but if analysis report processing fails for some reason, the icon changes:\\n\\n![background task processing failed.](/images/backgroundTaskProcessingFailedIcon.jpeg)\\n\\n\\n## F.A.Q.\\n\\n**Q.** Analysis errors out with `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded`. What do I do?  \\n**A.** This means your project is too large or too intricate for the scanner to analyze with the default memory allocation. To fix this you'll want to allocate a larger heap (using `-Xmx[numeric value here]`) to the process running the analysis. Some CI engines may give you an input to specify the necessary values, for instance if you're using a Maven Build Step in a Jenkins job to run analysis. Otherwise, use Java Options to set a higher value. Note that details of setting Java Options are omitted here because they vary depending on the environment.\\n\"},{\"path\":\"analysis/pull-request\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Pull Request Analysis\\n---\\n\\n<!-- sonarqube -->\\n\\n_Pull Request analysis is available as part of [Developer Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html)_\\n\\n<!-- /sonarqube -->\\n\\n\\nPull Request analysis allows you to:\\n\\n* see your Pull Request (PR) analysis results in the SonarQube UI and see the green or red status to highlight the existence of open issues.\\n* automatically decorate your PRs with SonarQube issues in your SCM provider's interface. \\n\\nPRs are visible in SonarQube from the \\\"branches and pull requests\\\" dropdown menu of your project.\\n\\nWhen PR decoration is enabled, SonarQube publishes the status of the analysis (Quality Gate) on the PR.\\n\\nWhen \\\"Confirm\\\", \\\"Resolved as False Positive\\\" or \\\"Won't Fix\\\" actions are performed on issues in SonarQube UI, the status of the PR is updated accordingly.

In case you made some changes on the issues (false-positive, won't fix), these changes will be reported on the long-lived branch.\\n\\n**Q:** Can I still use `sonar.branch`?  \\n**A:** `sonar.branch` is deprecated. You can still use it but it will behave the same way it always has: a separate project will be created. We encourage you to smoothly migrate your users to the new parameter `sonar.branch.name`.\\nPlease note you cannot use `sonar.branch` together with `sonar.branch.name`.\\n\\n**Q:** Can I manually delete a branch?  \\n**A:** This can be achieved by going into the Administration menu at Project's level, then Branches.\\n\\n**Q:** How do I control the lifespan of a short-lived branch?  \\n**A:** As a global admin, you can set the parameter sonar.dbcleaner.daysBeforeDeletingInactiveShortLivingBranches to control how many days you want to keep an inactive short-lived branch.\\n\\n**Q:** Does the payload of the Webhook contain extra information related to Branches?  \\n**A:** Yes, an extra node called \\\"branch\\\" is added to the payload.\\n\\n**Q:** When are Webhooks called?  \\n**A:** When the computation of the background task is done for a given branch but also when an issue is updated on a short-lived branch.\\n\\n**Q:** What is the impact on my LOCs consumption vs my license?  \\n**A:** The LOC of your largest branch are counted toward your license limit.

When you are not using Developer Edition, this is the only branch you see.\\n\\n## Analysis\\n\\nA branch is created when the `sonar.branch.name` parameter is passed during analysis.\\n\\n| Parameter Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\\n| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `sonar.branch.name`   | Name of the branch (visible in the UI)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\\n| `sonar.branch.target` | Name of the branch where you intend to merge your short-lived branch at the end of its life. If left blank, this defaults to the master branch. It can also be used while initializing a long-lived branch to sync the issues from a branch other than the Main Branch. |\\n\\n### Git History\\n\\nBy default, TravisCI only fetches the last 50 git commits. You must use `git fetch --unshallow` to get the full history. If you don't, new issues may not be assigned to the correct developer.\\n\\n### Configuring the Branch type\\n\\nA regular expression is used to determine whether a branch is treated as long-lived or short-lived. By default, branches that have names starting with either \\\"branch\\\" or \\\"release\\\" will be treated as long-lived.\\n\\nThis can be updated globally in **Configuration > General > Detection** of long-lived branches or at project's level in the **Admininstration > Branches**.\\n\\nOnce a branch type has been set, it cannot be changed. Explicitly, you cannot transform a long-lived to short-lived branch, or vice-versa.\\n\\n## See also\\n* [Short-lived Branches](short-lived-branches)\\n* [Long-lived Branches](long-lived-branches)\\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](branches-faq)\\n\"},{\"path\":\"branches/long-lived-branches\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Long-lived Branches\\n---\\n\\n<!-- sonarqube -->\\n\\n_Branch analysis is available as part of [Developer Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html)_\\n\\n<!-- /sonarqube -->\\n\\n## Status vs Quality Gate\\n\\nThe same quality gate that is applied to the project as a whole is automatically applied to long-lived branches as well. This is not editable.\\n\\n## Issue Creation and Synchronization\\n\\nDuring the **first analysis only**, issues (type, severity, status, assignee, change log, comments) are synchronized with the Main Branch. In each synchronized issue, a comment is added to the change log of the issue on the long-lived branch: \\\"The issue has been copied from branch 'master' to branch yyy\\\".\\n\\nThen, at each subsequent analysis of the long-lived branch, any new issue that comes from a short-lived branch automatically inherits the attributes (type, severity, ...) the issue had in the short-lived branch. A comment is added to the change log of the issue on the long-lived branch: \\\"The issue had been copied from branch 'the short-live branch' to branch yyy\\\".\\n\\n## Leak Period\\n\\nBecause long-lived branches will persist for a long time, you are likely to develop and release multiple versions from it, and so you can change the Leak Period of a long-lived branch in **Administration > Branches**.\\n\\n## Settings and Quality Profiles on Branches\\n\\nBranch settings and quality profiles default to those set for the master branch, and by design, it's not possible to configure other values.\\n\"},{\"path\":\"branches/short-lived-branches\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Short-lived Branches\\n---\\n\\n<!-- sonarqube -->\\n\\n_Branch analysis is available as part of [Developer Edition](https://redirect.sonarsource.com/editions/developer.html)_\\n\\n<!-- /sonarqube -->\\n\\n## Status vs Quality Gate\\n\\nFor short-lived branches, there is a kind of hard-coded quality gate focusing only on new issues. Its status is reflected by the green|red signal associated with each short-lived branch:\\n\\n* status: green / OK or red / ERROR\\n* error conditions:\\n  * new open bugs > 0\\n  * new open vulnerabilities > 0\\n  * new open code smells > 0\\n\\nIt is possible to change the status of a short-lived branch from ERROR to OK (red to green), i.e. mergable, by manually confirming the issues. The same is true for the False-Positive and Won't Fix statuses.\\nIt means the status of a short-lived branch will be red only when there are Open issues in the branch.\\n\\n## Issue Creation and Synchronization\\n\\nThe issues visible on the short-lived branch are the new issues corresponding to files modified in the branch.\\n\\nModified files are determined based on the checksum of each file on the sonar.branch.target and the short-lived branch.\\n\\n## Leak Period\\n\\nThe ephemeral nature of short-lived branches means no explicit Leak Period is necessary; it's all new code. Thus, no \\\"new code\\\" data is available for a short-lived branch.\\n\\n## Settings and Quality Profiles on Branches\\n\\nBranch settings and quality profiles default to those set for the master branch, and by design, it's not possible to configure other values.\\n\\n## Known Limitations\\n\\n* Only the number of bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities and files are computed. As a consequence, you have no way to get a Quality Gate status as such on short-lived branch.\\n* You cannot connect SonarLint to a short-lived branch.\\n* Analysis of a short-lived branch based on another short-lived branch is not supported.\\n\"},{\"path\":\"custom-measures\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Custom Measures\\nscope: sonarqube\\n---\\n\\nSonarQube collects a maximum of measures in an automated manner but there are some measures for which this is not possible, such as when: the information is not available for collection, the measure is computed by a human, and so on. Whatever the reason, SonarQube provides a service to inject those measures manually and allow you to benefit from other services: the Manual Measures service. The manual measures entered will be picked during the next analysis of the project and thereafter treated as \\\"normal\\\" measures.\\n\\n## Managing Custom Metrics\\nAs with measures that are collected automatically, manual measures are the values collected in each analsis for manual metrics. Therefore, the first thing to do is create the metric you want to save your measure against. In order to do so, log in as a system administrator and go to **[Administration > Configuration > Custom Metrics](/#sonarqube-admin#/admin/custom_metrics)**, where the interface will guide you in creating the Metric you need. \\n\\n## Managing Custom Measures\\nCustom measures can be entered at project level. To add a measure, sign in as a project administrator, navigate to the desired project and choose **Administration > Custom Measures**, where you will find a table with the latest measure value entered for each metric. \\n\\nValues entered in this interface are \\\"Pending\\\", and will not be visible outside this administrative interface until the next analysis. \\n\\n\"},{\"path\":\"fixing-the-water-leak\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Fixing the Water Leak\\n---\\n\\n## What is the Water Leak\\n\\nImagine you come home one day to find a puddle of water on the kitchen floor. As you watch, the puddle slowly gets larger.\\n\\nDo you reach for the mop? Or do you try to find the source and fix it? The choice is obvious, right? You find the source of the leak!\\n\\nSo why do anything different with code quality? When you analyze an application with SonarQube and realize that it has a lot of technical debt, the knee-jerk reaction is generally to start remediating – either that or put together a remediation plan. This is like mopping the floor once a day while ignoring the source of the water.\\n\\nTypically in this traditional approach, just before release a periodic code quality audit result in findings the developers should act on before releasing. This approach might work in the short term, especially with strong management backing, but it consistently fails in the mid to long run, because:\\n\\n* The code review comes too late in the process, and no stakeholder is keen to get the problems fixed; everyone wants the new version to ship.\\n* Developers typically push back on the recommendations made by an external team that doesn't know the context of the project. And by the way the code under review is obsolete already.\\n* There is a clear lack of ownership for code quality with this approach. Who owns quality? No one!\\n* What gets reviewed is the entire application before it goes to production and it is obviously not possible to apply the same criteria to all applications. A negotiation will happen for each project, which will drain all credibility from the process\\n\\nInstead, why not apply the same simple logic you use at home to the way you manage code quality? Fixing the leak means putting the focus on the “new” code, i.e. the code that was added or changed since the last release. Then things get much easier:\\n\\n* The [Quality Gate](/quality-gates) can be run every day, and passing it is achievable. There are no surprises at release time.\\n* It's pretty difficult for developers to push back on problems they introduced the previous day. Instead, they're generally happy to fix the problems while the code is still fresh.\\n* There is a clear ownership of code quality\\n* The criteria for go/no-go are consistent across applications, and are shared among teams. Indeed new code is new code, regardless of which application it is done in\\n* The cost is insignificant because it is part of the development process\\n\\nAs a bonus, the code that gets changed the most has the highest maintainability, and the code that doesn't get changed has the lowest, which makes a lot of sense. Because of the nature of software, and the fact that we keep making changes to it, the debt will naturally be reduced. Where it isn’t is where it doesn't need to be.\\n\\n## How to do it\\n\\nSonarQube offers two main tools to help you find your leaks:\\n\\n* Leak Period metrics show the variance in your measures between the current code and a specific point you choose in its history, typically the `previous_version`\\n* New Code is primarily detected based on SCM \\\"blame\\\" data (starting from the first analysis within your Leak Period), with fallback mechanisms when needed. See SCM integration for more details.\\n* [Quality Gates](/quality-gates) allow you to set boolean thresholds against which your code is measured. Use them with differential metrics to ensure that your code quality moves in the right direction over time.\\n\"},{\"path\":\"housekeeping\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Housekeeping\\n---\\n\\nWhen you run a new analysis of your project, some data that was previously available is cleaned out of the database. For example the source code of the previous analysis, measures at directory and file levels, and so on are automatically removed at the end of a new analysis. Additionally, some old analysis snapshots are also removed.\\n\\nWhy? Well, it's useful to analyze a project frequently to see how its quality evolves. It is also useful to be able to see the trends over weeks, months, years. But when you look back in time, you don't really need the same level of detail as you do for the project's current state. To save space and to improve overall performance, the Database Cleaner deletes some rows in the database. Here is its default configuration:\\n\\n* For each project:\\n  * only one snapshot per day is kept after 1 day. Snapshots marked by an event are not deleted.\\n  * only one snapshot per week is kept after 1 month.

You can copy-paste the command line displayed at the end.\\n\\n2.  On Bitbucket Cloud, go to the \\\"Settings > Pipelines > Environment variables\\\" page of your team, and add a new SONAR_TOKEN variable that contains the value of the SonarCloud token (something like `9ad01c85336b265406fa6554a9a681a4b281135f`) which you created during the [tutorial](/#sonarcloud#/onboarding) (and which is available inside the command line that you copy-pasted). **Make sure that you click on the \\\"Lock\\\" icon to encrypt and hide this token.**\\n\\n3.  Inside the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file of your repository, copy the command line provided by the tutorial and replace the actual token by its variable name.

For example:\\n\\n* No new blocker issues\\n* Code coverage on new code greater than 80%\\n* Etc.\\n\\nIdeally, all projects will be verified against the same quality gate, but that's not always practical. For instance, you may find that:\\n\\n* Technological implementation differs from one application to another (you might not require the same code coverage on new code for Web or Java applications).\\n* You want to ensure stronger requirements on some of your applications (internal frameworks for example).\\n* Etc.\\n\\nWhich is why you can define as many quality gates as you wish. Quality Gates are defined and managed in the **[Quality Gates](/#sonarqube#/quality_gates)** page found in the top menu.\\n\\n## Use the Best Quality Gate Configuration\\n\\nThe quality gate \\\"Sonar way\\\" is provided by SonarSource, activated by default and considered as built-in and so read-only. It represents our view of the best way to implement the Fixing the Water Leak concept. At each SonarQube release, we adjust automatically this default quality gate according to SonarQube's capabilities.\\n\\nThree metrics allow you to enforce a given Rating of Reliability, Security and Maintainability, not just overall but also on new code. These metrics are recommended and come as part of the default quality gate. We strongly advise you to adjust your own quality gates to use them to make feedback more clear to your developers looking at their quality gate on their project page.\\n\\nDon't forget also that quality gate conditions must use differential values. There is no point for example to check an absolute value such as : Number of Lines of Code is greater than 1000.\\n\\n### Recommended Quality Gate\\n\\nThe `Sonar way` Built-in quality gate is recommended for most projects. If focuses on keeping new code clean, rather than spending a lot of effort remediating old code. Out of the box, it's already set as the default profile.\\n\\n## Quality Gate Status\\n\\nThe current status is displayed prominently at the top of the Project Page:\\n\\n![Quality Gate Status](/images/quality-gate-status.jpeg)\\n\\n## Getting Notified When a Quality Gate Fails\\n\\nThanks to the notification mechanism, users can be notified when a quality gate fails. To do so, subscribe to the **New quality gate status** notification either for all projects or a set of projects you're interested in.\\n\\n## Security\\n\\nQuality Gates can be accessed by any user (even anonymous users). All users can view every aspect of a quality gate.\\n\\nTo make changes (create, edit or delete) users must be granted the **Administer Quality Profiles and Gates** permission.\\n\\nA **project administrator** can choose which quality gates his/her project is associated with. See Project Settings for more.\\n\\n## Defining Quality Gates\\n\\nTo manage quality gates, go to **[Quality Gates](/#sonarqube#/quality_gates)** (top menu bar).\\n\\nEach Quality Gate condition is a combination of:\\n\\n* measure\\n* period: **Value** (to date) or **Leak** (differential value over the Leak period)\\n* comparison operator\\n* warning value (optional)\\n* error value (optional)\\n\\nFor instance, a condition might be:\\n\\n* measure: Blocker issue\\n* period: Value\\n* comparison operator: >\\n* error value: 0\\n\\nWhich can be stated as: No blocker issues.\\n\"},{\"path\":\"quality-profiles\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Quality Profiles\\n---\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe Quality Profiles service is central to SonarQube, since it is where you define your requirements by defining sets of **rules** (ex: Methods should not have a Cognitive Complexity greater than 15).\\n\\nIdeally, all projects will be measured with the same profile for any given language, but that's not always practical. For instance, you may find that:\\n\\n* The technological implementation differs from one application to another (for example, different coding rules may apply when building threaded or non-threaded Java applications).\\n* You want to ensure stronger requirements on some of your applications (internal frameworks for example).\\n* Etc.\\n\\nWhich is why you can define as many quality profiles as you wish even though it is recommended to have as few Quality Profiles as possible to ensure consistency across the projects in your company. To manage quality profiles, go to <!-- sonarqube -->[**Quality Profiles**](/#sonarqube#/profiles)<!-- /sonarqube --><!-- sonarcloud -->**Quality Profiles** page of your organization<!-- /sonarcloud -->, where you'll find profiles grouped by language.\\n\\nEach language plugin comes with a predefined, built-in profile (usually called \\\"Sonar way\\\") so that you can get started very quickly with SonarQube analyses. This is why as soon as you install a new language plugin, at least one quality profile will be available for you. Each language must have a default profile (marked with the Default tag). Projects that are not explicitly associated with a specific profile will be analyzed using the language's default profile.\\n\\nWhen starting from a new installation, it's tempting to use Sonar way as your default profile because it contains all the rules that are generally applicable to most projects. But as a best practice, you should create a new profile (you can populate it by copying the contents of Sonar way) and use it instead. Why? First because Sonar way profiles aren't editable, so you won't be able to customize it to your needs. Also, that lets you treat Sonar way as a baseline against which you can track your own profile as you make changes to it (and you will). Plus, Sonar way is typically updated with each new version of the plugin to add rules and sometimes adjust rule severities. Any profile that inherits from the built-in Sonar Way will de-facto be automatically updated at the same time.\\n\\n## How do I...\\n\\n### Delegate the management of Quality Profiles to someone else?\\n\\nBy default, only users with the \\\"Administer Quality Profiles\\\" permission can edit Quality Profiles. But in large organizations, it may not be desirable to grant permissions to change all the Quality Profiles without distinction. That's why you can also grant users/groups the permission to edit an individual Quality Profile so that, for instance, the management of the Swift profile can be delegated to a group of Swift experts, and the same for COBOL, ...\\n\\nThis delegation of permission can only be performed by someone who already has the \\\"Administer Quality Profiles\\\" permission or individual edit rights on the profile to which additional permissions should be granted. The interface to grant individual permissions is available on the profile detail page.\\n\\n### Copy the rules from one profile to another?\\n\\nMany times people want to work from a profile that's based on a built-in profile without actually using the built-in profile. The easiest thing to do in this case is to go to the original profile, we'll call it _Source_, in **Quality Profiles**. From there, click through on the total number of rules in _Source_ to land on the **Rules** page at a pre-narrowed search of _Source_'s rules. Use **Bulk Activate** to turn Source's rules on in your target profile.\\n\\n### Know what's changed in a profile?\\n\\nWhen SonarQube notices that an analysis was performed with a profile that is different in some way from the previous analysis, a Quality Profile event is added to the project's event log. To see the changes in a profile, navigate to the profile (**Quality Profiles > [ Profile Name ]**), and choose **Changelog**. This may help you understand how profile changes impact the issues raised in an analysis.\\n\\nAdditionally, users with Quality Profile administration privileges are notified by email each time a built-in profile (one that is provided directly by an analyzer) is updated. These updates can only be caused by analyzer updates.\\n\\n### Copy a profile from one SonarQube instance to another?\\n\\nUse the **Back up** feature on the source instance to export the profile to an XML file. Use the **Restore Profile** feature on the target instance to import the file. Note that some [limitations](https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONAR-5366) on this feature exist.\\n\\n![Restore Quality Profile](/images/restore-quality-profile.jpeg)\\n\\n### Apply a core set of rules plus additional rules to a project?\\n\\nLet's say your company has a minimum set of coding rules that all teams must follow, but you want to add rules that are specific to the in use technology in your project. Those rules are good for your team, but irrelevant or even misleading for others. This situation calls for inheritance. Set up a base profile, we'll call it _Root_ with your core set of rules. Then create a child profile, we'll call it _Sprout_. Once it's created, you can **Change parent** to inherit from _Root_, then add your missing rules.\\n\\n### Make sure my non-default profile is used on a project?\\n\\nOne profile for each language is marked the default. Barring any other intervention, all projects that use that language will be analyzed with that profile. To have a project analyzed by a non-default profile instead, start from **Quality Profiles**, and click through on your target profile, then use the Projects part of the interface to manage which projects are explicitly assigned to the profile.\\n\\n### Make sure I've got all the relevant new rules in my profile?\\n\\nEach time a language plugin update is released, new rules are added, but they won't appear automatically in your profile unless you're using a built-in profile such as _Sonar way_.\\n\\nIf you're not using a built-in profile, you can compare your profile to the built-in profile to see what new on-by-default rules you're missing.\\n\\nAnother option is to go to the **Rules** space, and use the **Available Since** search facet to see what rules have been added to the platform since the day you upgraded the relevant plugin.\\n\\nAnd finally, the profile interface itself will help you be aware of rules added in a new plugin version in the **Latest New Rules** section on the right of the interface.\\n\\n### Compare two profiles?\\n\\nStarting from the **Quality Profiles** page, click through on one of the profiles you'd like to compare, then use the **Actions > Compare** interface to select the second profile and see the differences.\\n\\n### Make sure I don't have any deprecated rules in my profile?\\n\\nThe **Deprecated Rules** section of the rules interface itself is your first warning that a profile contains deprecated rules. This pink-background section gives the total number of instances of deprecated rules that are currently active in profiles, and a breakdown of deprecated count per profile. A click-through here takes you to the **Rules** page to edit the profile in question.\\n\\nAlternately, you can perform a **Rules** search for the rules in a profile (either manually or by clicking-through from **Quality Profiles** page) and use the **Status** rule search facet to narrow the list to the ones that need attention.\\n\\n## Security\\n\\nThe Quality Profiles service can be accessed by any user (even anonymous users). All users can view every aspect of a profile. That means anyone can see which rules are included in a profile, and which ones have been left out, see how a profile has changed over time, and compare the rules in any two profiles.\\n\\nTo make rule profile changes (create, edit or delete) users must be granted the **Administer Quality Profiles and Gates** permission.\\n\\nA **project administrator** can choose which profiles his project is associated with. See Project Settings for more.\\n\"},{\"path\":\"security-reports\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: Security Reports\\n---\\n\\n## What do the Security Reports show?\\nThe Security Reports are designed to quickly give you the big picture on your application's security, with breakdowns of just where you stand in regard to each of the [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10), and [SANS Top 25](https://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors) categories, and [CWE](http://cwe.mitre.org/)-specific details.\\nThe Security Reports are fed by the analyzers, which rely on the rules activated in your quality profiles to raise security issues. If there are no rules corresponding to a given OWASP category activated in your Quality Profile, you will get no issues linked to that specific category and the rating displayed will be A. That won't mean you are safe for that category, but that you need to activate more rules (assuming some exist).\\n\\n## What's the difference between a Hotspot and a Vulnerability?\\nVulnerabilities are points in the code which are open to attack.\\nSecurity Hotspots are security-sensitive pieces of code that should be carefully reviewed by someone with a security auditor hat. This person can be:\\n* a member of the development team who is more sensitive to security problems \\n* someone outside the development team contracted for the purpose of reviewing these Hotspots.\\n\\nThe main goal of Security Hotspots is to help focus the efforts of the security auditors who manually review application source code. The second goal is to educate developers and to increase their security-awareness. \\nHaving a Hotspot in your application does not mean there is a problem. What it does mean is that a human, preferably a security auditor/expert should look over the code to see if the sensitive piece of code is being used in the safest manner.\\n\\n## Why don't I see any Hotspots?\\nThey are three reasons you might not see any Hotspots:\\n* it is possible you really have none of them because the code has been written without using any security-sensitive API. \\n* it is possible that Hotspot rules are available, but not yet activated in your Quality Profile, and so naturally no issues are raised\\n* it is more likely that the analyzer for the langauge you're using does not yet offer Hotspot rules, and so it doesn't raise any Hotspots regardless of the quality of how many are actually there, but this last option will disappear over time.\\n\\n## Why don't I see any Vulnerabilities?\\nYou might not see any Vulnerabilities for more or less the same reasons as for Hotspots, but it may be more surprising for Vulnerabilities because you may see some Vulnerabilities reported in the Project homepage, while there are none in the Security Reports. This is because the language analyzer may not yet provide the \\\"Security Standards\\\" metadata required for issues to be visible on the Security Reports. This metadata is basically the link between a Rule (and its issues) and the \\\"OWASP Top 10\\\" or \\\"SANS Top 25\\\" categories. Without this link, there is no way to associate an already existing Vulnerability to the Security Standard categories and so to display security issues correctly in the reports. Every analyzer version released by SonarSource after July 2018 should feed the \\\"Security Standards\\\" and be compatible with the Hotspot issue type. \\n\\n## I'm a developer. Should I care about Hotspots?\\nProbably not. Hotspots, as such, aren't really actionable. They simply mark *potential* problems, so there's really nothing to do immediately on the code. That's why you don't receive notifications when Hotspot issues are raised, and why Hotspots aren't shown in the Issues page by default.\\n\\n## What if my Hotspot really marks a Vulnerability?\\nIf you look at the code where a Hotspot is raised and realize that there really is a problem, click on the current status (probably `Open`) to register that you've *Detect*ed a Vulnerability at that point in the code. Once you do, it will be converted to a Vulnerability, and the developer who last touched the line will receive \\\"new issue\\\" notifications (if she's signed up to get them).\\n\\n## What happens after my Hotspot becomes a Vulnerability?\\nOnce you've *Detect*ed that there really is a problem at a Hotspot location, it will be assigned to the appropriate developer, who will make a fix, and must then `Request Review` *via the UI*. That request moves the issue from Vulnerability back to Hotspot. From there, it's up to the security auditor to either `Accept` or `Reject` the fix. Accepting the fix will mark it `Won't Fix`, and rejecting it will turn it back into a Vulnerability, putting it back in the developer's queue.\\n\\n## What does it mean for a Hotspot to be marked \\\"Won't Fix\\\"?\\nThe `Won't Fix` designation is used to indicate that a Hotspot has been reviewed and there is no way, as of now, to exploit this piece of code to create an attack.\\n\\n\\n\"},{\"path\":\"security\",\"content\":\"---\\ntitle: SonarCloud Security\\nscope: sonarcloud\\n---\\n\\nWe know that your code is very important to you and your business.
